      <h2>Why the change in career?</h2>

      <p>
        A poll shows nearly half of teachers in England plan to quit within the
        next five years. Ahead of the National Education Union (NEU) annual
        conference in Bournemouth this week, it published data on Monday
        revealing that <strong>44% </strong>of teachers plan to leave the
        profession by 2027. In a survey of 1,788 teachers, a fifth (22%) said
        they would leave within two years. Teachers said their heavy workload
        was a significant factor in their decision to leave. More than half of
        respondents <strong>52% </strong> said the workload was “unmanageable”
        or “unmanageable most of the time”, up from 35% in 2021.
      </p>

      <p>
        For those planning to leave within two years, workload was the key
        motivation for 65% of respondents, while concerns about the level of
        trust in teachers from the public and government were also a significant
        factor. Teachers also cited pay and accountability as reasons to
        consider leaving. “I am desperate to get out of education due to
        workload, constant monitoring and paperwork,” one teacher said. Teachers
        said schools were finding it difficult to fill vacancies, leading to a
        doubling up of roles, with 73% reporting the issue had got worse since
        the start of the pandemic. “People leave and then their responsibilities
        [are] added to another role,” one teacher said. Another described how
        “everything is pared to the bone”. “We have increased leadership
        responsibilities but our time to carry this out has been axed,” they
        added. “Classes are covered by teaching assistants on a regular basis,
        as if this is perfectly satisfactory.” Two-thirds of secondary school
        teachers (66%) said the issue of vacant teaching assistant and support
        staff posts had worsened since March 2020. One respondent said there
        were <strong>“far too few”</strong> teaching assistants and they were
        being asked to cover classes more than ever before. For those who had
        thought about stress at work, two-thirds reported they were stressed at
        least 60% of the time, with one teacher reporting that stretched
        staffing had left staff “close to burnout”.
